![Calculator](image-1.png)

## Project Overview

The Calculator GUI Program is a Python application that implements a basic calculator with a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Kivy framework. The calculator supports arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It provides buttons for digits (0-9), a decimal point, percentage, and common arithmetic operators. Additionally, special buttons for clearing the entire input, clearing the current input, and deleting the last character are included. The current calculation is displayed on the screen, and a scrollable area shows the calculation history with results.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:**

  - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

- **Numeric Buttons:**

  - Buttons for digits 0-9, a decimal point, and percentage.

- **Special Buttons:**

  - CE (Clear All), C (Clear), DEL (Delete), and = (Evaluate).

- **Calculation History:**

  - Display of calculation history in a scrollable area.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Program:**

   - Execute the program to launch the Calculator GUI.

2. **Calculator Interface:**

   - The GUI features an output label at the top for the current calculation and a scrollable area below for the calculation history.

3. **Numeric Input:**

   - Click on the numeric buttons to input digits, the decimal point, or percentage.

4. **Arithmetic Operations:**

   - Click on the corresponding buttons (+, -, \*, /) to perform arithmetic operations.

5. **Special Buttons:**

   - CE (Clear All): Clears the entire input and history.
   - C (Clear): Clears the current input.
   - DEL (Delete): Removes the last character from the input.
   - = (Evaluate): Calculates the result.

6. **History Display:**

   - The calculation history is displayed below the current calculation. Scroll to view more entries.

## Example

```bash
cd CalculatorGUI
python calculator.py
```
