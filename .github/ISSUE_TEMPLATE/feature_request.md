**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Currently, users are unable to customize the font size in the application, which makes it difficult for visually impaired users to read the text comfortably.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I would like to have the ability to adjust the font size within the application settings. This would allow users to increase or decrease the font size based on their preferences and needs.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
An alternative solution could be to provide pre-defined font size options (small, medium, large) instead of allowing users to customize the font size manually.

**Additional context**
Adding this feature would greatly improve the accessibility of the application and make it more user-friendly for a wider range of users, including those with visual impairments.
