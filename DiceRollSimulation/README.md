![Dice ROll](../assets/images/readme_images/dice_roll.png)

## Project Overview

The Dice Roll Simulation Program is a Python implementation that allows users to simulate rolling dice with various features. It supports both single-player and multiplayer modes, where players can roll different sets of dice. The program includes statistics, a histogram of rolled values, and probability calculations. Additionally, it provides an animated representation of dice rolling for an interactive experience.

## Features

- **Dice Types:**

  - Users can choose the type of dice (e.g., 4-sided, 6-sided, 10-sided) to simulate different dice games.

- **Statistics:**

  - Displays statistics about the rolled values, such as the total sum, average, minimum, and maximum values.

- **Histogram:**

  - Creates a histogram or bar chart to visually represent the distribution of rolled values.

- **History:**

  - Keeps a history of all rolled values and displays it upon request.

- **Probability Calculation:**

  - Calculates and displays the probability of each possible outcome.

- **Custom Dice:**

  - Allows users to define custom dice with specific numbers on each side.

- **Multiplayer Mode:**

  - Supports rolling multiple sets of dice for multiplayer games.

- **Animated Dice Roll:**

  - Adds a graphical representation of dice rolling for a more interactive experience.

- **Dice Notation:**

  - Implements support for standard dice notation (e.g., 2d6 for rolling two six-sided dice).

- **Error Handling:**
  - Implements proper error handling for invalid inputs or unexpected scenarios.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Program:**

   - Execute the program to begin the dice roll simulation.

2. **Single Player Mode:**

   - Enter the number of sides on the dice and the number of rolls to simulate.

3. **Multiplayer Mode:**

   - Specify the number of players, the number of sides on the dice, and the number of rolls per player.

4. **Dice Types:**

   - Choose the type of dice to simulate different dice games.

5. **Statistics:**

   - View statistics about the rolled values, including total sum, average, minimum, and maximum values.

6. **Histogram:**

   - Visualize the distribution of rolled values through a histogram.

7. **Probability Calculation:**

   - See the probability of each possible outcome based on the rolled values.

8. **Animated Dice Roll:**

   - Opt for an animated representation of dice rolling for a more interactive experience.

9. **Dice Notation:**

- Use standard dice notation (e.g., 2d6) for rolling specific sets of dice.

12. **Error Handling:**
    - Receive clear error messages for invalid inputs or unexpected scenarios.

## Example

```bash
cd DiceRollSimulation
python dice_roll_simulation.py
```

```python
Enter the number of sides on the dice: 6
Enter the number of rolls: 10

Statistics for Single Player:
Total Sum: 32
Average: 3.20
Minimum Value: 1
Maximum Value: 6

Probability of Each Outcome:
Value 1: 20.00%
Value 2: 10.00%
Value 3: 30.00%
Value 4: 10.00%
Value 5: 20.00%
Value 6: 10.00%

Do you want to animate the dice rolls for this round? (yes/y or no/n): yes
```

## Features to be Added

- **Interactive GUI:**

  - Develop an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) for a seamless user experience.

- **Custom Dice Configuration:**

  - Allow users to define custom dice with specific values on each side.

- **Custom Sound Effects:**

  - Enable users to customize or choose different sound effects for a personalized experience.

- **Probability Visualization:**

  - Provide a graphical representation of probability calculations for better visualization.

- **Error Logging:**

  - Implement a comprehensive error logging system for better debugging and issue resolution.

- **Dice Game Templates:**

  - Include predefined templates for popular dice games with specific rules and configurations.

- **User Profiles:**

  - Allow users to create profiles to track their simulation preferences and history over multiple sessions.

- **More Animation Options:**
  - Introduce more animation options, such as different styles or speeds, for the animated dice roll feature.
