# Conway's Game of Life Program

![Game of Life](image.png)

## Project Overview

Conway's Game of Life is a classic cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway in 1970. The Game of Life is not a traditional game with players and a win/lose condition. Instead, it's a simulation where a grid of cells evolves over time based on simple rules. Each cell can be in one of two states, alive or dead, and the evolution of the grid is determined by the states of neighboring cells.

## Description of the Game of Life

### Rules

1. **Underpopulation**: Live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies.
2. **Survival**: Live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
3. **Overpopulation**: Live cell with more than three live neighbors dies.
4. **Reproduction**: Dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive.

### How to "Play"

1. **Initialization**: Start with an initial grid of cells.
2. **Evolution**: Apply the rules iteratively to evolve the grid.
3. **Observation**: Watch patterns emerge, change, or stabilize.
4. **Interactivity**: Modify initial configurations or parameters for different outcomes.

### Key Concepts

- **Cells**: Each cell can be alive or dead.
- **Generations**: The game evolves in discrete time steps.
- **Patterns**: Includes stable patterns, oscillators, gliders, etc.

## Conclusion

Conway's Game of Life is a fascinating exploration of emergent behavior, complexity theory, and cellular automata. The Game of Life showcases how simple rules can lead to intricate and unpredictable patterns, making it a captivating study in mathematics and computer science.
