## Project Overview

The Chessboard Program is a Python application that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for displaying a chessboard. It allows users to place chess pieces. The program supports customization of colors for light squares, dark squares, and selected squares. Users can save and load board states, and the initial placement of standard chess pieces (pawns, rooks, knights, bishops, queens, and kings) is included. Additionally, users can customize chessboard colors using user-defined color codes.

## Features

- **GUI Interface:**

  - Provides a graphical user interface for interactive use.

- **Chess Piece Placement:**

  - Allows users to place chess pieces on the board.

- **Customizable Colors:**

  - Users can customize the colors for light squares, dark squares, and selected squares.

- **Save and Load Board States:**

  - Supports saving and loading board states to/from a file.

- **Initial Placement of Chess Pieces:**

  - Automatically places standard chess pieces at the beginning of the game.

- **Customization of Chessboard Colors:**
  - Allows users to define their own color codes for a personalized chessboard appearance.
